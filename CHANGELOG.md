## v0.2.0 — 2025-10-09

### Added
- Published a reusable `pkg/logging` service with console and JSON encoders, typed field helpers, and dedicated tests so other binaries can share gHTTP's logging stack.

### Changed
- Rewired the CLI, HTTPS workflow, and file server to emit all events through the centralized logging service, keeping request and lifecycle logs consistent across JSON and console modes.
- Moved the logging implementation into `pkg/logging` to make the abstraction importable by external consumers without reaching into `internal/`.
